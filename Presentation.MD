How can it be possible for tests to have 100% coverage and still miss bugs?

Why is it that anytime we perform manual review we end up identifying combinations not covered by tests?

Is there a way to systematically identify and explore all smart contract combinations?

## Examples

- TODO: Add both motivating examples and a few bugs

## Coverage Classes

- Fully explained at this point, add SECRET if we can ship it in time

## External Coverage as part of our systems coverage

## Implied Lines

## Implied state

## Metaproperties

## World splits
